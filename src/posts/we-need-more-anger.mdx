There I was, running through the Boston Commons, fists punching the warm evening air, drop-kicking the void, a concoction of rage and energy bursting through me.

It had been a long time since I had a relationship with anger.
My turbulent childhood—mixed with the desire to rise beyond life circumstances—invited a deep desire for peace.
There wasn't room for anger in my vision of self.
And so, my inner intensity was silenced by a vast and calculated calm.

That all changed when I got on the sailboat.

After finishing my month-long yoga teacher training in India, I was mentally, physically, and spiritually exhausted. 
I wanted to spend the rest of eternity melting away into an infinite cozy sofa.

But I couldn't.

Before I left for travels, a good friend and life mentor mentioned he was bringing together a group of men on a sailing retreat.
He aimed to invite a deeper conversation about masculinity and how to show up as a good man in this world.
The world needs more thoughtful and loving men, and I jumped at the opportunity to experience what he had in store.

Fast forward to September and I found myself on a tall-ship off the coast of an uninhabited U.S island, surrounded by a profound group of fifteen other men.
Through thoughtfully planned exercises, we were exploring a LOT of different topics. 
A few days in, we set out on rowboats towards the island's beach to begin our next exercise.

"You're all going to get mad." one of the retreat leaders said.

The group looked around.
What was he talking about?

"Here, let me show you."

He proceeded to wade out into the water, and with shocking intensity began screeching and pounding his fist into the endless ocean.
It sounded like a bear fighting off a lion.
I had never seen anything like it.
It was scary, it was intense, it was beautiful.

And then he stopped.

"Okay, now it's your turn. GET FUCKING ENRAGED."

Fuck it, might as well right?
I made my way out into the water.
And with all the energy I couldn't muster, proceeded to flick a few splashes of water into the air.
It sounded like a leaky faucet fighting off the urge to drip one last time.
Womp womp.

The anger clearly wasn't present in my physical expression.
But, I didn't want to give up.
Instead, I widened my stance, flexed my core and from the depths of my soul let out a deep enduring guttural roar.
It didn't feel like what I thought anger would, but there was something brewing there.

And then, before I knew it, the retreat was wrapping up.

I returned to Boston to take care of my belongings before continuing on with world travel.
It was a geo-limbo that gave me a glimpse of my old life.

There was only one problem.

A few months back, during my travels, my partner and I broke up.
Because it was my first time back since then, I still had everything she'd left in my apartment.

It had been months since we had talked, and she made it clear she didn't want to be contacted.
So, I phoned up one of our mutual friends...

"Hey man, this is super awkward, but I still have her stuff. Can you help?"

Within a few days she got back to me.
Because of the nature of separating while traveling, there was a lot left unsaid.
Like many well-intentioned-starting conversations, the unsaids emerged and we soon found ourselves texting emotions at each other.
It got heated, fast.

A thought emerged.
Maybe I should give this anger exercise another try.

I put my headphones in, tossed on a "Rage Playlist", and head-bobbed my way into the Boston Commons.
An immense energy bubbled up as I found myself running around, dropping into push ups, thrusting up into head stands, punching the air and drop-kicking the void.
To anyone walking by, I looked like a crazy-person, and it was glorious.

It was profoundly empowering.
I felt alive and deeply in touch with my life.
I said what needed to be said to the universe, to myself, and I could go home now.

On the walk back, she texted me to apologize.
At the same time, someone texted me with an awesome opportunity.

It felt like magic.

And then, I crashed into my bed and slept like a baby.

Since then, I've been working on ways to better channel my intensity.
Where there was once an aversion to feeling anger, there is now a thriving curiosity on how to harness it for good.

Before I had access to anger, it was really hard to tell someone I was hurting.
It caused me to say goodbye to a good woman, because I didn't have the emotional maturity to say fuck you instead.

I hope to say fuck you more.

So this is a call to your divine masculine (whether you're a man or woman); go punch some fucking air.
Rage it out.
Let your darkness win the day.
And then reflect on the potent intensity you hold inside.
