title: An experiment in radical transparency

For a while now I've wanted to set up a personal website. I finally was able to purchase the domain name, had been working on my front-end development skills, had a moment of free time between projects, and finally decided to pull the trigger and get started.

"What the f\*ck do I even put on here" was my first thought. I'm not looking for a job (at the moment) and a resume seemed unnecessary. My next thought was that there aren't a lot of people out there searching for "Curtis Fisher." Who is going to even view this site? I've been wanting to build this for so long but was realizing that I had nothing important to share and nobody outside of my life who needed to learn about who I am and what I do.

So I started to reflect on my own values. What do I care about? I pulled up my notes and began typing. Honesty was my number one value. I kept typing away until I finally realized...

Why don't I put my values on my website? I'm writing it in my notes now, but what if I simply store them online and keep track of it there? It's not like they're a big secret anyway. That got the ball rolling. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that a lot of things that I keep in my personal notes to track my life—my reading list, resources I've found, goals, projects I'm working on, etc...—could all be stored online. And if honesty is my number one value, why not be transparent and open about it all?

curtisfisher.com was born. I decided to use it as a place to track my life in the most open and honest way I could. Aside from the information that would lead me to be kidnapped and eaten by cannibals (dear cannibal, please don't eat me if you're reading this) I'm committed to documenting everything I can about my life out in the open. This site is for myself, to keep track of my life, and for anyone interested in reading it.

My hourly wage, money earned from projects, hardest challenges, and songs I sing in the shower are all fair game. I'll do my best to highlight the most relevant information and treat this website primarily as a personal-growth journal. I'm not sure how this experiment in openness will play out, I really hope I don't get eaten by cannibals, and I'm super excited to see where this goes :)
