If you haven't met me, I wear flip flops. Rain, snow, summer, winter... the flip flops are on.

Last week I stepped in a deep puddle.

For the first time that day, I chuckled.

A year ago that kind of thing would have upset me. It is humbling to see how my character has grown in such a short amount of time.

Life has many experiences to offer: from periods of rapid personal "success", to the big emotional fall, to stepping in puddles. It's all so absurdly natural; I can't help but chuckle these days.
