There I was, barreling down a Thai highway at 140km/hr on a motorbike I'd never ridden before.
My phone was dead, it was pitch black out (not that I could see through the rain anyway), and I was three hours from Bangkok.
Lightning was crashing down around me, and it turns out rain drops really hurt at 140km/hr when you're not wearing face protection.
There were stray dogs in the road causing me to slam on my breaks occasionally, and the wind was so strong that it blew me back and fourth between lanes.
The biggest thought on my mind at the time was, "That was such a lovely conversation with the monk."

We'll come back to the monk, but like my [short story about stepping in a puddle](/blog/flip-flops-and-puddles), I found so much joy with the hand that life had dealt me.
When I reflect on the circumstances, there was so much chaos going on around me.
During the experience I remember the gratitude I had for being presented with the challenge of enduring it.

A few big takeaways from that experience

- Rain starts to sting at 80/kmh but it's bareable
