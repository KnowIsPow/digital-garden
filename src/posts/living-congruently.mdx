How does one live well?
This is a question I've asked myself with increasing curiosity over the past year.
In searching for the answer to this question, I've stumbled upon the works of Plato, the hellenistic philosophies (more to come on stoicim), the dharmic religions, and countless personal growth books.
One theme is starkly represented in this exploration: **congruency is essential to a good life.**

## What is Congruency

To be completely straightforward, I made up my own definition for this word.
This is the definition that I use:

_Congruency is both a process and an outcome. To live congruently is to live in accordance with your desired reality. To practice congruency is to take actions which align you with your desired reality._

Some might call it self-awareness, some call it authenticity, to me, congruency makes the most sense. The shape of your thoughts is the same as the shape of reality.

## The relationship between "Congruency" and "The Good Life"

Reality can take many forms.
Congruency is when you are living **your** best reality.
Different philosophies, religions and spirtualities all have their own definition of the best form of reality, "The Good Life."
Here are a few examples in the wild of "The Good Life" and what it requires of an individual.

_Preface: I am not an expert in any of the following religions, spirtualities, or philosophies. Addressing the complexities of these profound and ancient ideas in a single article would be the kind of character building experience that I'm not yet ready for. Please have grace with my attempt to highlight what I find to be most relevant._

### Dharmic religions (~3000 B.C.E.)

There is no firm date of origin for the Dharmic religions.
The vedic texts date back to at least 3000 B.C.E but some have dated them to as far back as 8000 B.C.E.
The Dharmic religions were born from a culture fixated on mastering the spirtual realm.
Salient among their shared themes is the pursuit of self-relization and the belief that individuals can achieve spirtual enlightenment by understanding the true nature of the self.

#### Hinduism

In Hinduism, the ultimate goal is to liberate oneself from the cycle of rebirth (samsara) to enter a state of moksha (unity with the divine).

#### Buddhism

In Buddhism, the ultimate goal is to become liberated from samsara to enter a state of nirvana (perfect happiness). From what I can understand, the primary difference between to ultimate goal of Hinduism and Buddhism is the concept of atman (the self). In Hinduism, atman is an eternal part of the divine that one fully realizes after growing beyond maya (the illusion of reality). In Buddhism atman is a part of the illusion of reality, and liberation can only be achieved by realizing the emptiness of all things, including the self.

A Buddhist is congruent when (s)he has escaped samsara and embodies the oneness of the universe. A Buddhist practices congruency by following the Eight Fold Path

#### Sikhism

In Sikhism, the ultimate goal of human life is to become spirtually liberated and merge with God.

#### Jainism

In Jainism, the ultimate goal is a life of ahimsa (non-violence).

### Abrahamic Religions (~2000 B.C.E.)

The Abrahamic religions date back to ~2000 B.C.E. when Abram (later known as Abraham and also referred to as Ibrahim in the Qur'an) was chosen by god to spread the message of monotheism.

Common to the Abrahamic religions is the shared belief in one true god, and a life lived in accordance with God's will.

#### Christianity

Christians practice the teachings of Jesus Christ in order to live in accordance with the will of god. A Christian is living congruently when they have embodied Christ's teachings to become a living manifestation of God.

#### Judaism

Jews practice the teachings of the Torah to live in accordance with the will of god.

#### Islam

Muslims practice the teachings of the Qur'an to live in accordance with the will of Allah.

#### Comedic Relief

In the Abrahamic religions, The Good Life is one lived in accordance with God. After writing The Good Life so many times, one might accidentally miss a letter and write The God Life. The Good Life is The God Life. Get the joke? Ha. ha.

### Helenistic Schools of Thought (~300 B.C.E.)

#### Epicurianism

The Epicurians practive living a life of katastematic (static) pleasure—free from unnecessary desires and fears. An Epicurian is living congruently when she has aligned her desires and pleasures with reason and moderation.

#### Stoicism

The Stoics practice living in accordance with nature, concerning themselves with only that which is within their control. A Prokopton (one who is progressing on the stoic path) is congruent when their beliefs and actions align with the natural order of the universe.

#### Skepticism

The Skeptics aim to live a life embodied by ataraxia (total serenity). A Skeptic is congruent when they have found tranquility in matters of opinion and moderation of feeling in matters forced upon them.

## TLDR; Common Themes

1. Realization of the illusive nature of reality (maya, living sinfully, living without reason)
2. Elimination of negativity (suffering, sin, pain, struggling against nature, etc...)
3. Alignment with a higher power (God, the Logos, Nirvana, etc...)

Spiritual and Philosophical texts serve as guides to congruent living

## Why one should aim for congruency

Congruency is both the process of aligning ones actions with the actions of the good life, and the essence of the good life itself.
It is precisely from the moment of congruent alignment that we are living well.

For those who aim to live well, it helps to know what a well-lived life looks like.
Many spirtualities, philosophies, and belief systems attempt to answer this question; it's up to you as an individual to choose what resonates.
This is certainly not an easy task, and your beliefs of The Good Life may change many times throughout your life.

A congruent person is intimately familiar with the self.
They know where they fall flat of their ideals, and where they are leaps and bounds ahead of where they once were.

When your breath smells bad, and you know your breath smells bad, that's congruent.

When someone says "how was your day," and you say "Honestly, I really need a hug right now," that's congruent.

When you recognize that your angry at someone or something, and can pinpoint your own internal issues leading to that anger, that's congruent.

Congruency is both the standard with which we look up to, our ultimate goal, and a reflection of the actions we choose in each moment.
It is precisely from the ownership of your true state–the distance between you and the good life–that you can begin to improve your circumstances.
Living congruently gives a life its purpose.

## Concluding Thoughts

I don't yet know (and may never know) the full extent of what it takes to live well.
One thing I do know is that it's highly improbable we will stumble into the good life.
The good life seems like something that we must work for;
that work starts with understanding who we _truly_ are—**that is clarifying where we are and are not congruent**—and beginning to progress in our alignment from there.

By aiming for congruency you are pulling and propelling yourself into your personal good life.
Each congruent step you take is one step closer to living well.
