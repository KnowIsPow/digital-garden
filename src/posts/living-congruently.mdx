How does one live well?
This is a question I've asked myself with increasing curiosity over the past year.
In searching for the answer to this question, I've stumbled upon the works of Plato, the hellenistic philosophies (more to come on stoicim), the dharmic religions, and countless personal growth books.
One theme is starkly represented in this exploration: **congruency is essential to a good life.**

## What is Congruency

Congruency occurs when your internal mental state aligns (is congruent) with the state of reality.
When you're emotionally unbalanced, are projecting ego, or are operating from a place of fear, congruency is what you achieve when you own and acknowledge those internal states.

Some might call it self-awareness, some call it authenticity, to me, congruency makes the most sense. The shape of your mind is the same as the shape of reality.

## The value of Congruency

When your breath smells bad, and you know your breath smells bad, that's congruent.
It is precisely from that ownership of your true state that you can begin to improve.

When someone says "how was your day," and you say "Honestly, I really need a hug right now," that's congruent.

When you recognize that your angry at someone or something, and can pinpoint your own internal issues leading to that anger, that's congruent.

A congruent person knows exactly who they are. They know where they fall flat, and where they are leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else. They understand their weaknesses and their strengths, and can clearly articulate their internal mental landscape.

I don't yet know (and may never know) the full extent of what it takes to live well.
One thing I do know is that it's highly improbably we will stumble into the good life.
The good life seems like something that we must work for;
that work starts with understanding who we _truly_ are—**that is being congruent with our personal reality**—and beginning to progress from there.
