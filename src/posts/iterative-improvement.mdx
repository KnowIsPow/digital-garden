My bedroom is my most sacred space.
It represent my mind manifest external.

When there are cloths scattered around the floor, I see undressed thoughts scattered around my brain.
When I haven't cleaned my bedsheets in a few weeks, it's a reminder that it's been far too long since I've reflected.
When my plants are withering, it reminds me that I am withering inside.

On the surface, these are small things.
What I've come to deeply intuit is that an unkept room is the manifestation of an unkept psyche.

This is why I love my bedroom.
Organizing my cloths feels like organizing my thoughts.
Cleaning my bedsheets is like cleaning my mind of weeks of unprocessed artifacts.
A new painting on a once empty wall represents an itch scratched in an neglected corner of my brain.
Watering my plants is watering my soul.

It's important that we love the spaces that we hold sacred.
Loving our sacred spaces is loving ourselves.
When is the last time you've taken a look at your most sacred space?
What does it tell you?
