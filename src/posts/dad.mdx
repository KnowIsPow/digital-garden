description: an appreciation of the man who brought me to life.

he walks with the swagger of a circus peanut.
he rocks baggy blue flannels and a sports jacket.

at seventy-six, he climbs into that still-passes-inspection blue subaru, whistling his way to the office.
that subaru parked outside sports games, science fairs, and performances.

he's nosy, he's finnicky, he's quick to frustration.

we gathered amidst a living-room where crumpled plastic cups lose themselves between the cushions.
we find ourselves together, paper plates in hand, savoring in his practice-turkey the week before thanksgiving.

once I was old enough, I set my sails on course in only one direction.
away.

my ship bore a dress-code.
all items which no longer had utility were promptly burned.
meals were steeped in routine and ritual.

I didn't appreciate work.
I hadn't withered enough life to understand why the couch was stuffed with trash.
and I didn't know how good it felt to join the circus.

my ship succumbed to the waves.
I was overdressed for a wreck.

I tore off the layers, as I plunged downwards.
my lungs squeezed tightly for the last drops of air. 

my heart stopped and I faded into the ocean current
and as I lay there in the sea-grass looking up at the fish, 
I was reminded that breathing around him was unconditional.

so I took a breath.

and now, I set off once again.

may I trade my precise ship for a cracked and broken bathtub.
may the curtains serve as my sails.

may I curl up into the bubbles, 
sipping virgin cocktails
and laughing in the mirror.

thank you for your gift, you old fart.
