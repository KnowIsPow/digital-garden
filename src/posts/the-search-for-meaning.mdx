## The Problem

In a doom-scrolling world, dominated by daily dopamine benders and automatically enhanced interactions we are missing something essential…

Truth.

It is becoming increasingly unclear what to believe in, and as virtual reality and content-churning AI continues to improve, we will slip further away from a meaningful life.

Spirituality is, in-part, the exploration of our Human Truth. That truth goes by many names, it's been called God, Love, the Tao, the Logos, Source and Nirvana to name a few. Civilizations, religious systems, and a humanity-old philosophical conversation have tried to answer the question, “Why are we here?”

The answer to that question is our Human Truth, and it's the depth of exploration to that question that we are losing touch with in an increasingly shallow world.


## The Solution

Create a community of thinkers. Bring together people who deeply care about Purpose and Being and invest in them greatly. Help them realize their full human potential in exploration of their Truth, and equip them with the tools to spread that curiosity to those lost to a shallow pursuit.

By reinvesting in humanity's undercurrent, the metaphorical substrate, intuition, or whichever name “The Deeper Conversation” goes by to you, we can help humanity rediscover its touch with a meaningful life.

Our species is suffering greatly. The cure to suffering is in the search for meaning. It's about time we reintroduce that search to the world conversation.
