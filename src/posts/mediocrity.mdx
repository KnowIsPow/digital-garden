Mediocre.
Less than.
Not as good as I thought I was.

These are labels I've recently given myself.

The grounded spiritual being tells me all is okay, to live in this moment, **to love.**<br />
And the wounded, restless stickler self-judge points out how I stumble.

I do my deeds, and I come up short again and again.

But I know, the fear of failure wakes me from my dreams.

So I push my boulder up this mountain.

All the while feeling my ship is lost in this life-sized ocean,
racing towards the nearest ground,
hoping The Lighthouse will save me from crashing.

But The Lighthouse is the crash.<br />
And the crash is cracking me open.

And in the cracks, there I see myself.

Wild, and precious, and incurably human.
