Mediocre.
Less than.
Not as good as I thought I was.

These are labels I've recently given myself.

The grounded spiritual being tells that all is okay, to live in this moment, **to love.**

And the wounded, restless stickler self-judge points out how I stumble.

I am doing my deeds, and I am coming short again and again.

But I know, the fear of failure is the one thing that makes dreams impossible to achieve.

So I continue to push my boulder up this mountain.

My ship, lost in a life-sized ocean.
Racing towards the nearest ground.
Hoping a Lighthouse will catch me from crashing.

But, the Lighthouse is the crash.

And the rocks are cracking me open.

And I am living my one wild and precious life.
