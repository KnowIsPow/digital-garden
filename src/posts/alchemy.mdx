One of my favorite books, The Alchemist, has this beautiful idea of "The Soul of The Universe."

[I grew up atheist](/blog/our-need-for-certainty). 
This soul of the universe concept, at first, seemed like a fictitious narrative element for creating a good story.
One of those "woo woo" ideas like chakras and holistic medicine.

## The hierarchy of meaning

Words are an atomic unit of communication.
With a single word, I can evoke meaning.

Above words, are sentences with which the words fit into.
Sentences provide us a more robust tool than words.
You can communicate more meaning per unit sentence, than you can per unit word.

Above sentences, are phrases with which sentences fit into.
They provide complex structure to our sentences.
The ability to move groupings of sentences around to construct stories.

Above those phrases are the thoughts and emotions that inspired the writing.

Above that is you, the observer.
The one who is neither your thoughts nor your emotions.

And finally, behind all of that is the soul of the universe.

Each of those levels represent a whole unit of meaning.
At higher levels, more meaning can be communicated.

The highest level, the soul of the universe, represents all meaning.

## You are multilingual

If you reverse this hierarchy, communication is the process of condensing infinite meaning into finite language.

Humans easily recognize verbal and written language as a standard tool for communication, but that's not the only language we speak.

You may be calm right now, or maybe anxious or sad or angry.
Reading this article while calm may evoke totally different thoughts than reading this while enraged.
Mood is a form of language.

You may approach a problem from an analytics lens or an abstract lens.
Those are both forms of language.

Music, painting, dancing, and cinema are all forms of finite language that help us to understand infinite meaning.

## We are Soulsuits

The process of being coincides with the process of distilling meaning.
We, the organism, channel the infinite meaning of the Cosmos through our finite set of languages.

> Through our eyes, the universe is perceiving itself. Through our ears, the universe is listening to its harmonies. We are the witnesses through which the universe becomes conscious of its glory, of its magnificence.

Being is a perpetual search for meaning.
We rarely have the perfect words or the exact story to communicate the full depth of our experience.

Inside of us, all around us is the infinite, but we only have our finite tools to converse with it.

## Deploying intuition & analysis

Intuition is the measure of our ability to identify meaning.
When we intuit something, we understand it right away.
It's an efficient operating form.

Analysis is the measure of our ability to communicate meaning.
When we analyze something, we observe the component units of meaning that contribute to the whole.
Analysis helps us find the right tools-words, lyrics, notes, colors-to demonstrate meaning.

These are both powerful abilities worthy of developing further.
