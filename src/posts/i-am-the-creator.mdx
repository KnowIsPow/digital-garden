I am the creator, and you are my creation.

In your smile, I see my dragonflies feasting and dancing.<br />
And in your angry outbursts, I see wind stirring leaves to chorus.<br />
And in your sadness, I see my ducks quietly drifting across the pond.<br />
And in your excitement, I see my wandering waves crashing against coastal rocks.<br />
And in your uncertainty, I see my ants marching toward a drop of honey.<br />

For I am the creator, and you are my beautiful creation.

I say you, but really, I mean me.<br />
We are one, my soul.

Sometimes, I forget that.
