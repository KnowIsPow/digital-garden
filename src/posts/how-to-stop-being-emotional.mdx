Do you or your friends consider yourself emotional?
If so, then this guide is for you!

## Why am I so emotional?

Emotions are a gift from our bodies.
They signal something worthy of our attention, and if listen closely, they often point to exactly what that thing is.
Many people fall into the trap of trying to fix their "negative" emotions.
The emotions themselves are not the problem, it is the thing they are signaling causing the issue.

We consider emotions such as sadness, anger, jealousy, and rejection negative.

If you notice "negative" emotions, you can honor those emotions by figuring out what they are trying to tell you.
If you're angry, you fix that by figuring out and addressing what is causing your anger.

If you feel hungry, it's a signal from your body to change something about your environment, to eat something.
In the same vein, if you feel sad, it's also a signal from your body.
The more you ignore what your body is telling you, the stronger your emotions will become.
When we repress our feelings, they have a way of manifesting themselves in manners that we didn't intend.

## Final Note

Emotions are simply a message from your body of something about your environment.
If you don't like the message, don't shoot the messenger, change the part of your environment sending the message.
