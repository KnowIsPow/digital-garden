## How to figure out what you love

Many people know what they love, and many people don't.
For those that are curious in exploring further there are many questions you can ask yourself to figure this out.

Take out a journal, open your notes app, or dictate to your parrot (however you take notes) and answer the following:

- What activities make you lose track of time?
- When do you feel most fulfilled and satisfied?
- What did you love doing as a child?
- What would you do if money wasn't a concern?
- Which activities energize you the most?

Once you write down your answers to these questions, look back through your notes.

Do you see any patterns emerging?

Your most common answers to these questions should provide you insight into what you love most.
If this doesn't help, try asking your parents, friends, partner, or anyone else who knows you well.
