Today my life changed forever.
Technically speaking, that's true of every day, but today felt especially different.

It's been my dream to open a holistic wellness center to help people heal.
I've spent countless hours researching land, construction, loans, programming, and people to make it all work.

The plan was to buy a large plot of land for cheap in the northeast United States, preferably on a lake or the ocean.
Phase one involved constructing pre-fab A-Frames or canvas tents for relatively cheap.
Then the wellness infrastructure would come; ice baths, saunas, a community yoga and meditation space, etc.
Finally, we would top the property off with an outdoor movie theater, a library, water sports and yard games.

That was until today.

I'm traveling in Thailand for the summer for the second time.
I didn't think I would return to it for a few years at least.

A buddy from the States who I've been dreaming up the center with happened to be nearby after reaching the summit of Everest.
His name is Evan, he's a badass.

He came to visit here on Koh Tao, and we went for a dive together.
On our way back to land, our dive instructor told us about an abandoned lighthouse hike on the island.
It sounded awesome.

A few days later Evan phoned me up, "Hey man, want to check out that lighthouse?"
Hell yeah I wanted to check out that lighthouse.

We hopped on our motorbikes and started our way towards the far-side of the island, up a mountain where the trail-head supposedly started.
About three-fourths of the way up the mountain we encountered a Thai woman at a gasoline and food stand she had thrown together.
We asked her where the lighthouse was and she pointed off to a road that I hadn't noticed before.

We made our way up the road until eventually we reached a stopping point.
Our maps said this was the place, but there was nothing except a gate.
One of those large swinging gates you would expect in a gated community.

We thought, "the trail must be closed, it's probably behind that gate."
So we did what any reasonable, respectable, citizens would do...
We ignored the gate and walked around it.

As we walked past the gate, we started walking up what looked like a driveway leading up a hill.
At the top of the hill, we could make out what looked to be a house, and the ocean far off in the distance.

We approached the house, and it was clearly abandoned.
What the heck was going on here?

We saw the lighthouse far FAR off in the distance, but mutually decided that this abandoned house was WAY cooler.
We stumbled through the property for a bit, and it was AWESOME.

It was perfect for a wellness center, was this property for lease?
To figure out what it was, we went back to the lady and her makeshift gasoline and food stand.
"Do you know who owns this property?"

She did.

"Do you know how to contact them?"

She didn't.
BUT, she did know who would have that information.
She told us to wait until 5 when the workers in the area got off work.

We waited for a while, playing with puppies running around the hill until finally a truck full of Thai workers approached.
They exchanged a few words with the lady and then one of us showed us their phone.
It was a phone number and a name.

Great, we got what we were looking for!
But, we were both skeptical.
This was Thailand, and we had heard many horror stories of visitors getting scammed.

My mind drew up stories of us paying large sums of money to lease the property only to find out that the people we were leasing from didn't actually own it.

Therefore, we decided to wait on contacting them.
The sun was setting, might as well catch the sunset while we were up at the top.

There was a small makeshift home / cafe / sunset view stand a little down the road.
We grabbed some waters and sat down to enjoy the sunset.

On a whim, we asked the woman running the stand if _she_ knew who owned the property.
She gave us the exact same number.
Two different people gave us the same contact information.

That was enough for us to reach out with a text.

"Hi, are you the owner of the resort on the hill?"

She replied, "Contact this number instead."

Another number...

We reached out to the number she gave us.

"Hi, are _you_ the owner of the resort on the hill? Are you interested in leasing it?"

He replied in seconds, "Yes, you can lease it."

Our eyes lit up.
Was this really happening?

We asked for a price and it was crazy affordable.
It seemed too good to be true.

We were skeptical, and the next day decided to go down to the land department to validate the deed.
It was the same name as the person we were contacting.

We quickly set up a meeting with the man...

This goes on for a few more days of skepticism, hesitation, and discussions between Evan, me, and the property owner.

So where does it end?

**I purchased an abandoned resort in Thailand.**

Nearly everything was thought through except for one small remaining detail: the fact that my dream wasn't going to play out where, when, or how I thought it was.

Life is funny like that.

These are the moments that feel like the universe is testing me.
It gave me exactly what I was asking for, a kickass wellness center. 
The only catch was that my life as I knew it would forever change.

I'm serious universe.
I accept your challenge.

HERE WE GOOOOO!
